Gobjdump is our own implementation of a Z80 disassembler.
It implements the normal Z80 instruction set (without instruction prefixes) and the following extensions:
    * instructions prefixed with 0xcb
    * instructions prefixed with 0xed

The examples/ directory contain sample Z80 binaries to test gobjdump. From the root of this repo try:
```
make
bin/gobjdump src/gobjdump/examples/bin.z80
```
